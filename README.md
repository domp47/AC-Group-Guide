# Animal Crossing Group Catch

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/DomenicPerriccioli/ACPipelines/_apis/build/status/ACPipelines-CI)](https://dev.azure.com/DomenicPerriccioli/ACPipelines/_build/latest?definitionId=7)

## Background
This idea is largely based off of *Sawyer Hood*'s [Animal Crossing Catch](https://github.com/SawyerHood/animal-crossing-catch).

The only thing that I would've preferred is to be able to have it centralized so I can access it from my phone, or laptop, or desktop etc. 

Also playing with friends is a big part of the game so why not be able to see which items your friends don't have so you can help them out? That's another feature this hopes to able to accomplish.
